# Delivery Time Prediction üì¶

This is a Streamlit web application that utilizes a pre-trained **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)** model to predict delivery times based on various input features such as location details, time information, GPS data, and distance. Simply enter the required values, and the app will provide a predicted delivery time along with a summary of the input features.

## Features
‚úÖ User-friendly interface with organized input fields grouped by category.  
‚úÖ Real-time prediction of delivery times using a pre-trained GBR model.  
‚úÖ Detailed input feature descriptions for better user understanding.  
‚úÖ Expandable sections for input features and additional information.  
‚úÖ **Error handling** for model loading and prediction processes.  

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- joblib

## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository:
